Dear Kamilla Ryan,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Mid-Level Data Engineer position at Akkodis, as advertised. With extensive experience as the sole data and infrastructure engineer in my current role, I have a proven track record of designing, building, and maintaining reliable data pipelines from the ground up, making me a strong fit for your team's ambitions.

At Motohaus Powersports, I spearheaded the modernisation of our data infrastructure by architecting and implementing a full data integration layer for our ERP systems. Faced with fragmented, error-prone manual workflows, I developed an automated ETL system using Python, PostgreSQL, and Docker handling data ingest from highly heterogenous data sources, both automated and manual. This solution now serves as the single source of truth for the business, managing the state of over ten thousand items and eliminating hours of manual data entry. This project required not only deep technical skills in data modelling and pipeline construction but also close collaboration with non-technical stakeholders to capture requirements and ensure the solution met real business needs.

The opportunity to work with Microsoft Fabric and Azure is particularly exciting. While my hands-on experience has been in provisioning and managing bare-metal Linux servers, my deep understanding of containerisation, networking, and infrastructure-as-code principles provides a robust foundation to quickly master cloud-native tooling. I am a passionate and self-motivated learner, a trait demonstrated when I independently designed a containerised MLOps pipeline for a stock forecasting system. My ambition to integrate AI and advanced analytics into business workflows aligns perfectly with the forward-thinking direction of your Data & Analytics team.

The description of a small, ambitious team focused on making a real impact resonates deeply with my own professional values. I am seeking a long-term position where I can not only apply my skills in building scalable data solutions but also grow with the company, and I am keen to contribute to and learn from a collaborative environment.

I am confident that my experience in driving data modernisation and my passion for building reliable, high-impact systems make me an excellent candidate for this role. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Frey Lyons
