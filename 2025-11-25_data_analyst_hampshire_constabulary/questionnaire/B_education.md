I hold a 1st-class Bachelor of Science (Honours) degree in Economics with Data Science from the University of Kent. This QCF Level 6 qualification has provided me with a comprehensive foundation in statistical analysis, data science, and computation. The curriculum included modules such as "Big Data and Machine Learning", "Introduction to Econometrics", and "Data Analysis for Economists", all of which have direct relevance to the role of a Data Analyst. My dissertation project involved a panel data analysis of US cities, where I applied my skills in data extraction, transformation, and regression analysis using Python, R, and SQLite. This academic background, combined with my professional experience, has equipped me with the necessary knowledge to understand and work with complex datasets.
