I have extensive experience in the end-to-end data lifecycle. I have a proven ability to present complex data to a range of audiences, for instance by creating a detailed report on financial data for a non-technical Managing Director and walking them through the findings. I consistently use my initiative to solve problems, such as independently designing and building an entire data integration system to automate a 5-hour weekly manual task. My experience of forming and maintaining internal and external relationships is demonstrated by my close collaboration with finance teams, suppliers, and senior leadership to translate user requirements into technical specifications. I am highly proficient in using Python and its data science libraries for data extraction and visualisation, and I have a working knowledge of data architectures from designing and implementing a production PostgreSQL database and ETL stack from the ground up.
