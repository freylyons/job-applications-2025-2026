While investigating stock valuation issues, it became clear that the technical data in QuickBooks did not align with the practical realities of how the finance team operated. To solve the problem, I needed to bridge the gap between the data and the business logic. This required building rapport and establishing effective working relationships with colleagues in the finance department. I proactively initiated several lengthy discussions with my finance colleagues. I shared my data insights and technical expertise, and in return, I listened carefully to their subject matter expertise to understand the nuances of the accounting processes. I worked cooperatively with them, using our combined knowledge to build a model of the stock valuation system. I learned about their priorities and the specific challenges they faced, which allowed me to tailor my analysis and recommendations to their needs. This collaboration was crucial in identifying the root cause of the problem. By working together and combining our diverse skills, we were able to move the project forward effectively. I have since become the go-to person for data-related queries from the finance team, demonstrating the trust and strong working relationship we have built.
