The business was facing a major issue with hugely inflated stock valuation figures in our accounting software, QuickBooks. The initial assumption was that there was an error in the "products and services" dataset. I was tasked with analysing the data to find and fix the error. This required me to think critically about the problem and separate opinion from fact to get to the root cause. I was tasked with conducting an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the "products and services" dataset. However, my analysis revealed that while there were data quality issues, this dataset was ultimately a red herring and not the cause of the stock valuation problem. I drew an effective conclusion from diverse sources of information, recognising that the core issue lay in the absence of historical purchase order data needed for accurate FIFO or AVERAGECOST calculations. I asked incisive questions of our finance team and researched the system's logic to confirm this. I then presented my findings to leadership, explaining how the initial assumption was incorrect and refocusing our efforts on the actual root cause. My critical analysis prevented the company from wasting further time on the wrong problem. It fundamentally changed our understanding of the issue and led to a complete overhaul of our data governance strategy. I assessed the available options and, applying business acumen, recommended a new approach which, although complex, would deliver the best results in the long run.
