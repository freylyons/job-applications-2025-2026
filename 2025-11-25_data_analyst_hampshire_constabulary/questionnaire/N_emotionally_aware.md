The customer service team was responsible for manually entering spare parts data, a tedious and error-prone task. This was causing them significant stress as they were already overwhelmed, and they had negative experiences handing over responsibilities to other teams in the past which they felt often caused more problems. My goal was to automate this process. Crucially, this required not just a technical solution, but also earning the team's trust. I needed to understand their concerns and ensure they felt supported and confident in the new system. I initiated direct conversations with the customer service team to understand their specific pain points and what they needed from a new system. I listened to their frustrations and anxieties, acknowledging their past negative experiences. I reassured them that my primary objective was to make their jobs easier, not more complicated. I developed the automation with their feedback in mind, providing them with clear, friendly documentation and extensive one-on-one support after the system went live to ensure they were comfortable and confident. The automation was a success, significantly reducing the team's workload and stress. By taking the time to understand their emotional needs and adapt my approach, I built a strong, trusting relationship with the team. They now feel comfortable approaching me with suggestions and issues, which has fostered a more collaborative and positive working environment.
