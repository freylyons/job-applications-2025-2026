Upon joining my current company, I identified that critical business processes were reliant on manual, error-prone data entry which took a full day of work per week and caused significant data quality issues. I took responsibility for solving this problem. My goal was to create a robust, automated system that would ensure data accuracy and free up valuable time for my colleagues. Acting as the sole data and infrastructure engineer, I took complete ownership of the project from conception to delivery. I independently provisioned a new server, designed a relational data model in PostgreSQL, and engineered a multi-stage ETL pipeline using Python and Docker. I proactively managed the project, providing regular updates to stakeholders and taking personal responsibility for seeing it through to a satisfactory conclusion. When I encountered obstacles, such as undocumented features of our ERP systems, I took the initiative to find solutions through extensive research and testing, and produced extensive documentation of systems and issues that I encountered as I went along. I successfully deployed a fully automated data integration layer that processes over 10,000 items daily. This has eliminated manual data errors, saved hundreds of hours of work, and provided the business with a reliable single source of truth for its product data. I take pride in the fact that I owned this problem and delivered an effective, timely solution.
