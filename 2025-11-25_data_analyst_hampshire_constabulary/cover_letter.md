Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Data Analyst position (HC622318) at Hampshire & Isle of Wight Constabulary, as advertised. With a strong background in end-to-end data engineering, complex data analysis, and a deep-seated motivation to contribute to the public good, I am confident that I possess the skills, experience, and ethical drive to excel in this role and support the Constabulary’s critical mission.

My current role as the sole data and infrastructure engineer at Motohaus Powersports has provided me with a unique and comprehensive skillset. I have been responsible for the entire data lifecycle, from provisioning bare-metal servers and designing data architecture to developing and deploying automated ETL pipelines using Python and Docker. A key project involved replacing a high-effort, error-prone manual data process with a fully automated system that now manages over 10,000 items daily. This demonstrates my ability to not only identify systemic issues but also to independently engineer robust, reliable solutions that deliver significant value. I am therefore excited by the prospect of applying my passion for data quality and visualisation to help Hampshire Constabulary understand crime, resources, and demand more effectively.

I am particularly drawn to this role because of the opportunity to work within a purpose-driven organisation. My academic research into the societal impact of large corporations, combined with my professional drive to build robust and ethical systems, aligns perfectly with the values of public service and courage outlined in the police service's Competency and Values Framework. Additionally, in a recent project to diagnose major discrepancies in our financial data, I took the initiative to conduct a deep-dive exploratory data analysis, working closely with our finance team to understand its implications. When communicating my findings to the Managing Director, I made a conscious effort to present the complex technical details in a clear, understandable manner, ensuring they could make informed strategic decisions. This experience highlights my ability to analyse critically, take ownership, and collaborate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders to achieve a common goal. I am a firm believer in the importance of transparency and accountability, and I am not afraid to challenge assumptions and ask incisive questions to get to the root cause of a problem.

I am a self-taught, highly motivated individual with a proven ability to learn quickly and adapt to new challenges. While my primary experience is with Python, I am confident in my ability to quickly become proficient in PowerBI and Business Objects. My experience in developing user requirements into technical specifications and my working knowledge of data architectures will allow me to quickly contribute to the team and deliver valuable insights.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how my skills in data analysis, engineering, and stakeholder management can contribute to making Hampshire and the Isle of Wight safer for everyone.

Sincerely,

Frey Lyons
