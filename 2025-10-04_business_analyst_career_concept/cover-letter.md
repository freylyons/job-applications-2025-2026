Dear Hiring Manager

I have just viewed your job vacancy for 'Business Analyst' (224120756) on CV-Library and would like to be considered for this position. I have a strong technical background with a first class Economics with Data Science degree and a programming proficiency level that had me put forward by my lecturers for a fully funded PhD scholarship, competing with masters graduates. I am incredibly strong in python, which I have been using for 12 years and used throughout my degree and beyond for all my maths, modelling, analysis, visualisation, and data transformation. I have also been developing a robust SQL skillset over the course of 2 years and have increasing experience in managing data with PostgreSQL databases, which I used to develop a data integration layer for my current company.

I have a passion for IT, both as a programmer and systems administrator, but also from an analytical perspective as the storage and usage of information is fundamental to the discipline of data analysis. I believe I would really thrive in a company of like-minded individuals, and would have a lot of value to bring to the team. I thoroughly enjoy setting up and configuring Linux systems, running Arch Linux on my home machines and my workstation in the office, Debian 12 for production systems, and a NixOS passion project at home on a remote bare-metal server. 

I believe the intersection of technological and analytical skills that I possess makes me well suited to this role, putting me in a good position to gain an enhanced perspective into multiple parts of the business. Furthermore, in my current role at an SME, I have developed a broad understanding of multiple business functions, with direct experience consulting with end users and stakeholders on user and business requirements.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you!

Kind regards,
Frey Lyons
