Dear Hiring Manager

I am applying for the role of Data Visualisation Engineer in Farnborough as advertised on CV-Library. I believe my skills in both data engineering and visualisation/exploratory data analysis make me a strong candidate for this role. I have been programming in python for 12 years now - in the last 4 years using it to perform data manipulation, exploration, transformation, and visualisation throughout my degree and my career. Furthermore, I have a strong grasp of normalised relational databases, having been building and querying databases for 2 years - from my dissertation and personal web scraping projects to a data hub/integration layer I have constructed in my current job, which handles both manual and automated data entry into multiple ERP systems through ETL pipelines, and handles listing logic for both B2C and B2B websites.

Additionally, my degree in Economics and Data Science makes me well placed to analyse data within a financial setting, having both completed a module in financial economics and a project to construct a basic MLP classification model with Quandl data to predict company defaults. Furthermore, I have tried and tested experience in exploratory data analysis, making use of it to discover significant coding and structural inconsistencies in the American Community Survey data I used for my dissertation, and in my current job where I discovered significant discrepancies in pricing and cost data in our accounting system.

Throughout my current job I have liased directly with end users, stakeholders, and external representatives to translate technical and user requirements into actionable plans. I receive great feedback from my coworkers, who report that the solutions I have implemented have made a significant improvement to their workflows, and that they find me understanding and helpful. From my training in the British Army's University Officers' Training Core, I learned to work on an iterative adaptive framework similar to agile, which I combine with my technical knowledge from statistics and game theory to estimate the optimal course of action based on project requirments and technical/time constraints.

To summarise, I think I meet the job description on a number of levels, having a strong technical background, good understanding of the specific tooling described, proven ability in data manipulation and exploration, experience working with various types of stakeholders in a fast moving and adaptable fashion, and the ability to learn and adapt quickly on the job.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind Regards,<br>
Frey Lyons
