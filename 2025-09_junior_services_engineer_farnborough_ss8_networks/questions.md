7.1 If your answer is yes, please provide an example. If you answer is no, enter "N/A".*


My primary role in my current company is to ensure data integrity. I maintain and develop rigorous input validation and have studied topics of mathematics such as measure theory to inform the design of my data modelling. I undertook statistical training in my undergraduate degree so I am intimately aware with the importance of data quality.


8. This role requires that you work directly with SS8 engineers, co-workers, and customers. No one is always right, but it is important that you have the ability to compromise and negotiate. Do you work well with others? *

No
8.1 If your answer is yes, please provide an example of a previous customer interaction. If you answer is no, enter "N/A".*

I regularly collaborate with both shareholders and end users in my current role. I recently implemented an upload process for the customer service team where I had to balance the requirements of data integrity and timely delivery from shareholders, and practical usability for non-technical customer service representatives. In order to meet these requirements, I proactively reached out to all relevant parties to discuss their needs to inform the requirements of the project


9. As a services engineer, you will be installing OS and Application software on various servers. Have you ever installed an OS or application software on an Unix/Linux server before? *
Yes
No
9.1 If your answer is yes, when did you do this and on what project. If your answer is no, enter "N/A".*

I have installed many linux machines: 2 arch linux and 1 nixos at home, 1 nixos server remotely as a personal project, 1 arch linux machine as a personal lab at my current workplace and a remote debian 12 server for development and production environments. All installations have been on bare metal devices.



10. You will need to know how to do IP configuration and need knowledge of troubleshooting connectivity issues. Do you have knowledge of TCP/IP protocols and general networking knowledge?*
Yes
No
10.1 If your answer is yes, please give an example of your previous experience. If your answer is no, enter "N/A".*


I have networking experience primarily with virtualisation technology, primarily using technologies like docker, and some remote servers. I have mapped IPv4 addresses provided by server providers to IPvlan docker container network and virtualbox machine. I have a basic understanding of DNS which I use to map domains and subdomains on the internet, and have set up NAT on a docker router node on a VPN network, which I use to gate access to internal network resources.



11. You will be looking at system logs and traces to find issues when testing or integrating services. Do you have any experience looking at logs and traces to identify issues? *
Yes
No
11.1 If your answer is yes, when did you gain this experience. If your answer is no, enter "N/A".*

I often read docker container logs to diagnose problems with service deployments, whether that be a pre-packaged service or one that I have developed and configured logging for myself. I have 4 years of intensive python experience and have been coding for nearly 12 years.
