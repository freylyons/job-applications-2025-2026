Dear Reuben Kamalarajan,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Senior Research Officer position at the Crown Prosecution Service, as advertised on the Civil Service Jobs website. With a strong background in designing and delivering quantitative research projects and a passion for using data to inform decision-making, I am confident that I possess the skills and experience necessary to excel in this role.

My motivation for applying to the CPS stems from a long-held desire to contribute to a purpose-driven organisation that serves the public good. My academic background in Economics with Data Science, particularly my dissertation research into the negative externalities of corporations on local communities, has solidified my commitment to applying my technical skills to address societal challenges. The opportunity to work within the CPS’s Strategic Research Team, providing evidence to tackle key criminal justice challenges, aligns perfectly with my personal and professional values.

In my current role as the sole data and infrastructure engineer at Motohaus Powersports, I have had the opportunity to lead on a variety of data-driven projects. A key achievement was the design and implementation of a data integration layer to consolidate the company's fragmented data management. This involved performing mass exploratory data analysis to identify systemic flaws, designing a new data model, and building automated ETL pipelines. This project eliminated pervasive manual data errors, and automated critical business workflows, which has been instrumental in demonstrating the value of research and analysis in addressing key business challenges. Furthermore, I have experience in communicating technical findings clearly to non-specialist stakeholders, working closely with them to understand their needs and ensure the solutions I build meet their requirements.

I am proficient in both Python and R for complex data analysis and have extensive experience with SQL and data-modelling. I am also experienced in designing research to meet stakeholder needs and I am confident in my ability to lead on the delivery of high-profile research projects.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my CV for your review and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,

Frey Lyons
