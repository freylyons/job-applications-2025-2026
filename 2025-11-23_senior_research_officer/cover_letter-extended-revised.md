With a background in quantitative analysis and a 1st-class degree in a social science with data science, I transform complex data into insights and robust systems. My experience is rooted in evidence-driven decision-making, aligning directly with GSR principles and Civil Service values.

### Making Effective Decisions

In my current role, I resolved a critical issue of fragmented, manual data management that caused pervasive errors and required five hours of manual work weekly, creating significant business risk. My task was to design a new, automated system to ensure data integrity and provide a scalable data foundation.

After analysing the options, I rejected a prior monolithic approach as unscalable. Instead, I architected a new system around a central PostgreSQL database as a master data store. This decision was based on rigorous analysis of business needs; it decoupled ingestion from loading, created a single source of truth, and handled both automated and manual data feeds. This demonstrated objectivity, basing the recommendation on technical and business merit. I then built a multi-layer containerised Python pipeline to extract, validate, and load the data.

The result was the complete automation of the process. The new system is a reliable, daily service ensuring accuracy for over 10,000 product listings, mitigating business risk and establishing a trusted, evidence-based data foundation.

### Seeing the Big Picture

During the data integration project, I recognised its potential to deliver value beyond the initial brief. The wider objective was to improve commercial performance, so I understood my role was to build infrastructure that supported the company's strategic goals.

With this context, I designed the system for scalability from the outset using a modular, containerised architecture. I went beyond the data-entry task to address the wider problem of controlling product visibility on the company's e-commerce sites. I designed and implemented a listing control service, creating an evidence-based list of orderable products cross-referenced with stock levels. This data-driven mechanism replaced guesswork and directly linked the data work to commercial outcomes.

The result is a system that has become critical infrastructure for the company’s websites and procurement. It enables the business to control its commercial offerings in a way that was previously impossible, showing how technical work can support wider organisational objectives.

### Managing a Quality Service

The primary users of the data integration system were non-technical staff burdened by a manual process. My goal was to deliver a high-quality, reliable, and trusted service.

To ensure the service met user needs, I collaborated directly with them to gather requirements and understand their pain points. A cornerstone of this quality service is reliability, which I addressed by introducing a formal `pytest` framework for containerised unit and integration tests. This new practice for the company significantly improved deployment reliability, ensuring a robust service and preventing regressions while handling company data with integrity.

The result was a high-quality, zero-maintenance automated service that replaced a five-hour weekly manual task. It freed up staff to focus on higher-value activities and provides timely, accurate data the business now depends on. The introduction of a testing culture has also raised the standard for future development.

### GSR - Knowledge and application of GSR technical skills

My dissertation, a self-directed quantitative project on the socio-economic effects of short-term rentals, demonstrates my formal research training. Using a panel data methodology across 821 US zip codes (2005-2021), I built a reproducible Python workflow for a complex ETL process, merging disparate spatial and survey datasets into an SQLite database. I then applied a robust within-fixed-effects regression model. While the analysis found no statistically significant relationship, it was a rigorous end-to-end exercise in applying econometric methods, from data engineering to advanced modelling and critical evaluation.

I applied these skills professionally when tasked with investigating a large stock valuation anomaly. I conducted a formal Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python, using univariate and multivariate analysis to identify duplicated primary keys, incorrect data joins, and systemic missing data as the root cause. This was confirmed by reading system documentation. I used correlation matrices and OLS regression to diagnose the data bias, presenting my findings in a structured report with clear visualisations. This showed my ability to apply a systematic research process to a messy, real-world dataset to diagnose a complex problem.

### GSR - Using and promoting social research

A key example of guiding stakeholders with analysis is my investigation into a significant data anomaly causing an seven-figure stock valuation error. While management requested a simple fix, my task was to use the opportunity to promote a more rigorous, evidence-led approach to data governance.

Through a systematic Exploratory Data Analysis, I discovered the problem was not a simple error but a systemic issue of data duplication and flawed migration processes. I authored a comprehensive 28-page report, using data visualisations to make the technical findings and their financial impacts accessible and persuasive for a non-technical audience.

My analysis successfully shifted the focus from the symptom to the root cause. My report provided an objective, evidence-based diagnosis with clear, actionable recommendations that were accepted by management. Translating a complex investigation into a compelling business case demonstrated the value of rigorous analysis and helped foster a culture that values evidence in operational decision-making.

I am confident I can bring a proactive, evidence-led, and collaborative approach to this role. Committed to Civil Service values, I am eager to apply my research and analysis skills to support the vital work of the Crown Prosecution Service.
