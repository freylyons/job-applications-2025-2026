As a data and research professional with a strong background in quantitative analysis and a 1st-class honours degree in a social science with data science, I am adept at transforming complex data into actionable insights and robust systems. My experience is rooted in using evidence to drive decision-making and improve organisational processes, aligning directly with the principles of the Government Social Research profession and the core values of the Civil Service.

### Making Effective Decisions

In my current role within a private-sector distribution company, I was tasked with resolving a critical business issue: a fragmented and entirely manual data management process. The situation was that product data from multiple internal systems and external suppliers was inconsistent, leading to pervasive errors and requiring five hours of manual data entry and cleaning each week. This created a significant risk of inaccurate information being presented to customers and hampered operational efficiency. The task was to design and implement a new system that would automate workflows, ensure data integrity, and provide a scalable foundation for the company’s data infrastructure.

To address this, I analysed the available options. The previous approach for a similar, smaller-scale task involved a single, monolithic process. I identified that this would not be scalable or resilient enough for the complexity of this challenge. Instead, I made the decision to architect a new system around a central PostgreSQL database to act as a master data store. I based this decision on a rigorous analysis of the evidence from the business requirements: it would decouple data ingestion from data loading, create a single, verifiable source of truth, and crucially, accommodate both automated data feeds and the archaic, manually-sent files from certain suppliers. This demonstrated objectivity, as my recommendation was based purely on the technical and business merits of the case. I designed and built a multi-layer containerised pipeline in Python, which extracted, validated, and stored data in the central database before transforming and loading it into the destination systems.

The result was the complete automation of a time-consuming and error-prone process. The new system now provides a reliable, daily-automated service that ensures the accuracy of over 10,000 product listings in a fast-moving commercial environment. This decision mitigated significant business risk, improved data quality, and established a trusted, evidence-based foundation for product data across the organisation.

### Seeing the Big Picture

Throughout the aforementioned data integration project, I recognised its potential to deliver value far beyond the initial brief. While the immediate problem was data entry, the wider organisational objective was to improve commercial performance and efficiency. I understood that my role was not just to write code, but to build infrastructure that supported the company's strategic goals.

With this broader context in mind, I designed the system for scalability and extension from the outset. I chose a modular, containerised architecture that could be easily adapted for future needs. A key action was to go beyond the data-entry task and address a wider business problem: accurately controlling which products were visible on the company's e-commerce websites. I designed and implemented a listing control service, creating a definitive, evidence-based list of all products that could be ordered and cross-referencing it with stock levels. This provided a data-driven mechanism to control website listings, replacing a process that was previously based on guesswork and manual checks. This directly linked the data work to the company's commercial outcomes and its national interest in maintaining a competitive retail presence.

The result is that the system has become critical infrastructure for the company’s websites and procurement operations. It has enabled the business to reason with and control its commercial offerings in a way that was previously impossible, demonstrating a clear understanding of how technical work can and should support wider organisational objectives.

### Managing a Quality Service

The primary users of the data integration system were non-technical internal staff who were burdened by the previous manual process. My goal was to deliver a high-quality, reliable service that would not only be more efficient but also be trusted by its users.

To ensure the service met their needs, I began by collaborating directly with these end-users to gather requirements and understand their pain points. This ensured the solution was designed to address real-world business needs. A cornerstone of delivering a quality service is reliability. To this end, I introduced a formal testing framework using `pytest` for containerised unit and integration tests. This was a new practice for the company and significantly improved the reliability of deployments, ensuring the service was robust and regressions were prevented. I took seriously my responsibility to handle the company's data and resources, reflecting the Civil Service value of Integrity.

The result was the successful delivery of a high-quality, zero-maintenance automated service that replaced a five-hour weekly manual task. This freed up significant staff time, allowing them to focus on higher-value activities. The service provides timely, accurate, and reliable data that the business now depends on, and the introduction of a testing culture has raised the standard for future development projects.

### GSR - Knowledge and application of GSR technical skills

My undergraduate dissertation provided an opportunity to conduct a full, independent research project from inception to conclusion, mirroring the project lifecycle of a government researcher. The project was a quantitative investigation into the socio-economic impact of short-term rental platforms on local labour markets in the USA, conducted at the ZIP-code level.

My task was to formulate a testable hypothesis and then source, process, and analyse data to produce robust, evidence-based conclusions. I designed the research methodology using a panel data approach. A significant part of the project involved technical data engineering skills to construct the dataset itself. I wrote Python scripts to execute a complex ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, sourcing raw data from multiple public sources, before cleaning, merging, and structuring it into an analysis-ready format within an SQLite database. I then conducted extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to validate the data and inform my modelling strategy. Applying my knowledge of econometrics, I used both R and Python to perform multiple regression analysis, ensuring my models were correctly specified to provide an unbiased and accurate answer to the research question.

The result was a formal research paper that successfully identified a statistically significant relationship, providing evidence of negative externalities. This project demonstrates my end-to-end capability in applying social research techniques: formulating a research question, designing the methodology, applying advanced data engineering and statistical analysis with tools like Python and R, and interpreting the results to produce meaningful findings.

### GSR - Using and promoting social research

In my current role, I have actively championed the value of data and research in a commercial environment where decision-making was not always evidence-based. My goal has been to demonstrate, through practical application, how a rigorous, analytical approach can solve business problems and lead to better outcomes.

My main project, the data integration layer, served as a key opportunity to promote this approach. I initiated the project by identifying a significant business pain point and engaging with non-technical stakeholders to build buy-in, clearly communicating the potential benefits of an automated, data-driven solution. I was honest and open about the process, ensuring that they understood the 'why' behind the technical work. By delivering a successful system that had a clear and positive impact—the automation of a major administrative task—I provided a powerful, practical demonstration of the value of applying research and analysis techniques.

The result was a tangible shift in the organisation's attitude towards data. The project's success created a demand for more data-driven solutions and established the principle of having a single, evidence-based source of truth. By making the data more accessible, reliable, and understandable, I empowered colleagues to make more informed decisions. The system is now seen as critical infrastructure, proving that by communicating the value of analysis and delivering clear results, it is possible to promote the wider use of evidence in decision-making.

I am confident in my ability to bring a proactive, evidence-led, and collaborative approach to this role. I am committed to the Civil Service values and am eager to apply my research and analysis skills to support the vital work of the Crown Prosecution Service.
