As the sole Data and Infrastructure Engineer at Motohaus Powersports Ltd, I am responsible for the entire data lifecycle, from raw data ingestion to insightful reporting and secure infrastructure management. My role is multifaceted, encompassing data engineering, analytics, and DevOps practices, ensuring data integrity, efficiency, and data-driven decision-making across the company.

My core duties and responsibilities include:

- Designing and Implementing Data Integration Automations: I act as the lead in developing and maintaining end-to-end Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines using Python and advanced SQL. This involves architecting data models, integrating disparate data sources (e.g., supplier feeds, ERP systems like Linnworks and QuickBooks), and ensuring data quality, consistency, and integrity. A key achievement is the development of a fully automated product data integration layer, which processes and manages information for over 10,000 items daily, significantly reducing manual errors and increasing operational efficiency.
- Data Analysis and Insight Generation: I perform comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand complex datasets, identify systemic issues, and inform strategic business decisions. This includes deep dives into operational data, such as stock valuation in QuickBooks, where I uncover trends, assess relationships, and communicate findings through clear, accessible reports and visualisations.
- DevOps and Infrastructure Management: I manage the full lifecycle of our data environments, from provisioning bare-metal servers with Debian to containerising applications using Docker and orchestrating services with Docker Compose. This ensures stable, reproducible, and scalable development, testing, and production environments. I also implement networking solutions and security protocols, including VPNs for secure access and managing secrets.
- Ensuring Data Quality and Governance: I implement robust data validation, logging, and quality assurance processes throughout all data pipelines. I maintain a working knowledge of data security, management, and information governance principles, safeguarding sensitive business information and ensuring compliance with internal standards.
- Stakeholder Collaboration and Communication: A significant part of my role involves bridging the gap between technical capabilities and business requirements. I collaborate extensively with non-technical stakeholders, including finance, customer service, and senior management, to gather requirements, communicate complex technical concepts, and provide guidance on data interpretation.
- Driving Continuous Improvement: I proactively identify areas for improvement in data processes and systems, proposing and implementing innovative solutions to enhance efficiency and reliability. I champion modern development practices, including version control and automated testing, to prevent regressions and maintain a high standard of work.

In essence, I am pivotal in transforming raw data into actionable intelligence, building the robust infrastructure to support these processes, and fostering a data-aware culture within Motohaus Powersports.
