I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Data Analyst position at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), a role I was excited to discover on the Civil Service Jobs portal. My application is driven by a long-held ambition to apply my skills in data analysis and engineering to a domain that delivers a tangible positive impact on society. The opportunity to contribute to the UK’s health security, particularly by working on flagship products like the UKHSA data dashboard, aligns perfectly with my professional motivations and technical expertise. With a 1st-class honours degree in Economics with Data Science and extensive hands-on experience as the sole data and infrastructure engineer in my current role, I have a strong foundation in the essential criteria outlined for this position.

My experience is rooted in a robust skillset in coding and data science best practices. I am highly proficient in Python and SQL, which I use daily to build and maintain data systems. For instance, I architected and implemented a multi-layer ETL stack to automate our company's product data management. This involved writing complex Python scripts for data extraction and transformation, utilising libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, and advanced SQL for data manipulation and retrieval within a PostgreSQL database. My commitment to good data science practice is demonstrated by my rigorous use of Git for version control, maintaining separate branches for development and production, and creating `justfiles` to automate and simplify complex Docker Compose commands, ensuring reproducible and reliable builds. Furthermore, I have developed and maintained a shared internal Python library, which centralises common functions and is thoroughly tested using `pytest`, reflecting the "Managing a Quality Service" behaviour by ensuring code is reusable, maintainable, and dependable.

The role requires experience in performing analysis to support business decisions, an area where I have a proven track record. In a recent project, I was tasked with investigating significant discrepancies in our QuickBooks stock valuation. I conducted a comprehensive exploratory data analysis, identifying the root cause not in the financial data itself, but in systemic data entry and governance issues. I used a variety of analytical techniques, including descriptive statistics, data visualisation, and regression analysis, to understand conflicting information drawn from multiple sources. This analysis directly demonstrates my ability to "assess data, find trends, drill down, assess relationships or causality", and is a clear example of the "Making Effective Decisions" behaviour. I presented these complex findings in a plain-English report to our non-technical Managing Director, enabling him to make informed strategic decisions. This experience has honed my ability to present, communicate and visualise data so that it is accessible to others, a crucial skill for this role at UKHSA.

I am particularly drawn to the data engineering aspects of this position. At my current company, I independently designed and built a new data model from the ground up for our product and reference data, reverse-engineering the logic from live, undocumented systems. This model, implemented in a PostgreSQL database, now serves as the single source of truth for all operational data. I designed and implemented the entire ETL process, which automates the cleaning, validation, and loading of data from multiple heterogeneous supplier sources into our ERP systems. This project is a strong example of my ability to implement data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes to ensure data quality and consistency. It also showcases the "Delivering at Pace" behaviour, as I successfully transformed a tedious, error-prone weekly manual task into a reliable, daily automated job that manages over 10,000 items, which is critical infrastructure for our business. While my direct experience is not with health-related datasets, my work on my dissertation, which analysed the negative externalities of Airbnb on the US labour market using complex panel data, demonstrates my capacity to quickly master new domains and handle intricate socio-economic datasets, a skill I am confident is transferable to the public health sector.

A key part of my current role involves working matrix-style with colleagues across the organisation, which aligns with the "Working Together" behaviour. I regularly collaborate with our finance team, customer service, and senior leadership. During the stock valuation project, I initiated lengthy discussions with finance colleagues, blending my data expertise with their subject-matter knowledge to synthesise technical requirements. This cross-functional collaboration was instrumental in identifying the critical data needed to solve the problem and demonstrates my ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical audiences. I am adept at translating business needs into technical specifications and vice-versa, ensuring that the solutions I build are not just technically sound but also fit for purpose.

While the job description mentions Power BI, and my experience is with Python libraries like Matplotlib/Seaborn, I am a fast and enthusiastic learner, as evidenced by my independently learning server provisioning, containerisation, and networking on the job. I am confident in my ability to quickly become proficient in Power BI, as the fundamental principles of effective data visualisation and dashboard design are universal. My commitment to "Changing and Improving" is a core part of my work ethic; I constantly seek out opportunities to learn new tools and methodologies to improve processes. This is also reflected in my deep understanding of data security, management, and information governance. In my current infrastructure, I have implemented secure access to services via a Tailscale VPN and router containers, and I am responsible for ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of all our business data.

My motivation for applying to UKHSA goes beyond the technical challenges. I am driven by a desire to contribute to work that has a real-world, positive impact. My academic background in economics, particularly my research into negative externalities, has given me a deep appreciation for the importance of public services and the role of data in addressing societal challenges. My personal values, including a commitment to social equity and inclusion, which I actively pursue through involvement in the LGBTQ+ community, resonate strongly with the Civil Service ethos. I am not just looking for a job; I am looking for a mission. The opportunity to use my skills to protect and improve the health of the nation is a powerful motivator for me.

In conclusion, I offer a unique combination of in-depth technical expertise in data engineering and analysis, a proven ability to lead projects and collaborate effectively with diverse stakeholders, and a genuine passion for public service. I am a proactive, autonomous, and dedicated individual who is committed to quality, reliability, and continuous improvement. I am confident that I possess the skills, experience, and mindset to excel as a Data Analyst at UKHSA and contribute meaningfully to your vital work. Thank you for your time and consideration.
