As the sole data and infrastructure engineer at Motohaus, I identified a critical business risk in the manual, spreadsheet-based management of e-commerce listings for over 10,000 products. This process was inefficient, prone to costly errors, and lacked a clear audit trail.

My objective was to deliver a robust, centralised, and automated service to act as a single source of truth for product data, control website listings, and provide value for money through increased efficiency and accuracy.

I independently designed, developed, and deployed a new data integration layer. This involved creating ETL processes, a PostgreSQL database for configuration and validation, and a secure administration interface. I worked with stakeholders across the business and external data controllers to gather requirements, set priorities, and ensure the system met their diverse needs. I established and documented new standardised data practices to ensure the long-term quality and maintainability of the service.

The new system fully automated data entry, becoming critical infrastructure for our e-commerce operations. It has saved significant staff hours, eliminated a key source of data error, and provides a reliable, high-quality service that underpins our online retail presence and procurement processes.
