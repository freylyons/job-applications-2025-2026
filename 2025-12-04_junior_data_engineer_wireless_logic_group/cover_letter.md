Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Junior Data Engineer position at Wireless Logic, as advertised. With a strong foundation in building automated data systems from the ground up and a passion for the transformative power of data, I am excited by the opportunity to contribute to your mission of shaping a data-rich and data-hungry business in the innovative IoT sector.

My experience as the sole data and infrastructure engineer at my current company has provided me with a robust, hands-on understanding of data engineering principles. I was tasked with consolidating fragmented and error-prone manual data workflows into a reliable, automated system. To achieve this, I architected and implemented a complete data integration layer using Python, PostgreSQL, and Docker. I designed the conceptual, logical, and physical data model, considering the normalisation level appropriate for maintaining and extending the system for heterogenous product information, built the ETL pipelines for ingestion and transformation, and now manage the infrastructure it runs on. This project automated the control of over 10,000 ecommerce product listings, eliminating manual errors and providing a single source of truth for critical business decisions, directly aligning with your goal to "unlock data as a superpower".

The prospect of working within a dynamic team and learning the Microsoft tech stack—including SSIS, MS SQL Server, and Power BI—is a significant draw for me. My extensive experience with advanced SQL, Python, and DevOps practices provides a solid foundation to quickly become a productive member of your team and embrace new technologies. I am a self-motivated and proactive learner, eager to build upon my experience by working with and learning from best-in-class senior developers.

I am deeply impressed by Wireless Logic's position as a market leader in the IoT space and your mission-driven approach. The opportunity to apply my skills to such a fast-growing and impactful industry is precisely the kind of challenge I am seeking. I am confident that my technical skills, collaborative spirit, and drive for quality make me an excellent candidate for this role.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my CV for your review and look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to the success of Wireless Logic.

Yours sincerely,

Frey Lyons
