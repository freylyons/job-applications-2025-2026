Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Senior Data Analyst position at Exclaimer, which I was excited to learn about through a referral from a current employee. They spoke very highly of Exclaimer’s fantastic culture, its recognition as a Great Place to Work®, and its genuinely inclusive and supportive environment for LGBT+ individuals. As someone driven by purpose and a desire to contribute to a positive workplace, this resonated deeply with me.

In my current role as the sole data engineer at Motohaus Powersports, I have been responsible for the entire data lifecycle. My proudest achievement has been architecting and building a scalable data integration layer from the ground up to solve the critical problem of fragmented, error-prone manual data entry. Previously, the company relied on hours of manual data processing each week to manage product information across multiple ERP systems, leading to inconsistent data and costly errors. My objective was to create a robust, automated system to serve as a single source of truth and eliminate these manual processes. I designed and implemented a relational data model in a PostgreSQL database to act as a semantic layer, then developed a suite of ETL pipelines in Python, containerised with Docker, to automatically extract, transform, and load data from various sources into our core systems. This involved extensive data cleansing, validation, and the creation of a shared Python library to ensure code was reusable and testable. This initiative successfully automated a task that previously took five hours per week, creating a reliable daily process that now governs data for over 10,000 items. It has become critical infrastructure, enabling consistent analytics and giving the business the ability to make data-driven decisions with trusted insights.

Furthermore, I have designed an MLOps pipeline for a stock forecasting system, applying my knowledge of advanced statistical modelling (time-series, regression) and my academic background in econometrics to architect services for cross-validation, training, and prediction. My experience in this area aligns directly with the requirements for this role.

My technical proficiency in SQL, Python, and Docker, combined with my experience in building scalable data models and collaborating with non-technical stakeholders, makes me confident that I have the skills and experience to excel as a Senior Data Analyst at Exclaimer. I am passionate about building high-quality, reliable data systems and am eager to contribute to your data-driven culture.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing this opportunity with you further.

Sincerely,

Frey Lyons
