I love university and the university environment. It has made me the person I am today and I would love the opportunity to give back and support furture cohorts of students going through the same challenges. I am excited by the opportunity to apply my data analysis skills in a mission-driven organisation dedicated to making a tangible, positive impact on student life. The role represents a perfect synthesis of my analytical capabilities and my personal values. I am particularly drawn to your vision of being "a place for everyone" and empowering students to change the world.

My passion for community building is evidenced by my extensive experience in leading and managing large online communities, where my focus was always on empowering members. The prospect of using data to better understand the needs of the student body and to help shape an environment where every student feels heard and supported is incredibly motivating. It aligns directly with my belief in using technology and data for social good.

Furthermore, the emphasis on turning insight into impact is a key reason for my excitement. While I enjoy the technical challenges of data analysis, my ultimate professional goal is to see my work translate into real-world change. The chance to lead research projects that directly influence strategy, improve services, and enhance student well-being is a unique and compelling opportunity. I am eager to contribute to a culture of data-driven thinking and help the Union deliver on its ambitious strategy to create the best possible university experience for students.
