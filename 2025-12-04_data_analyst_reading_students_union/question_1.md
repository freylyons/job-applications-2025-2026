As a data professional with a 1st-class degree in Economics with Data Science, I am confident I am an excellent fit for this Data Analyst position. My academic background has provided me with a robust foundation in quantitative and qualitative analysis, statistical modelling, and research best practices, directly aligning with the core requirements of the role.

In my current role as the sole data engineer and analyst at Motohaus Powersports, I have honed the advanced analytical skills you are looking for. My key achievement has been designing, developing, and deploying a full data integration layer from the ground up. This project involved cleaning and consolidating fragmented data from multiple sources, building ETL processes, and creating a unified PostgreSQL database. This system now acts as the single source of truth for the company, automating critical data entry and managing web listings for over ten thousand products. This experience demonstrates my ability to not only interpret and visualize complex data but also to build the foundational infrastructure required for generating reliable insights.

I am adept at turning raw data into compelling narratives and actionable strategies for diverse audiences. I regularly collaborate with non-technical stakeholders to capture requirements and present my findings through reports and visualisations, influencing key business decisions in procurement and e-commerce. Furthermore, my dissertation research on the labour market impacts of Airbnb involved large-scale panel data analysis using Python and R, showcasing my ability to lead impactful research projects from conception to completion. This blend of rigorous academic research and practical, in-house data strategy makes me well-equipped to help drive Reading Students' Union's data-driven strategy and champion a culture of evidence-based decision-making.
