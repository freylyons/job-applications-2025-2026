I believe I am a strong candidate for this role, with a background in data engineering, DevOps, and application development, as well as a proven ability to work across teams to deliver reliable and scalable services. I demonstrate technical knowledge and experience, problem solving and analytical skills, teamwork and communication, and adaptability and commitment to learning.

In my current role as Ecommerce Executive, I design and maintain ETL pipelines that automate complex data flows between systems such as QuickBooks and Linnworks, reducing manual handling and improving data accuracy. I containerise and deploy Python applications using Docker Compose and manage a Linux-based production environment on remote servers, including VPNs, DNS, and container networking. These responsibilities have required me to build solutions that are robust, maintainable, and well-documented, aligning with the expectations of supporting integrations and delivering high-quality services.

Alongside my professional work, I manage a self-hosted Hetzner server running NixOS, where I build personal services such as accounting, file hosting, and financial planning tools. This has deepened my experience with reproducible builds, declarative system configuration, and end-to-end service administration — skills directly relevant to developing integrations and supporting platforms such as Boomi.

Additionally, I have consistently demonstrated the ability to analyse processes, identify inefficiencies, and implement improvements. For example, I transformed a recurring two-hour weekly data cleaning task into a fully automated daily pipeline, and am designing robust data ingest processes throughout the business. This not only improved efficiency but also supported business decision-making with more timely and accurate data. My economics dissertation further strengthened my analytical skills, where I designed and executed a panel data study on the labour market impacts of Airbnb, applying econometrics, regression modelling, and exploratory data analysis.

I work closely with both technical colleagues and non-technical staff, translating business requirements into practical solutions. For instance, I designed data ingestion and forecasting pipelines with input from operational teams, ensuring the tools met their needs. I also produce documentation and testing frameworks, supporting transparency and collaboration across the business.

Beyond work, I have developed strong organisational and communication skills through five years leading a large online simulation group with 30–50 active members. This required coordinating schedules, documenting processes, and resolving conflicts — all within a voluntary, community-driven environment. I also completed leadership training through the University of London Officers’ Training Corps, where I gained formal experience in planning, leading teams, and managing logistics.

Furthermore, I actively seek out opportunities to broaden my technical skills. Recent examples include learning functional programming in Haskell to strengthen my coding practice and exploring machine learning pipelines for demand forecasting and stock prediction. I also stay up to date with emerging DevOps practices, such as CI/CD automation, container orchestration, and declarative configuration management.

Finally, I am motivated by the opportunity to apply my skills to projects that have a tangible impact on people’s lives. Hampshire County Council’s commitment to delivering efficient, high-quality digital services to the people of Hampshire strongly resonates with me. I am enthusiastic about contributing to projects such as data integration, customer service improvements, and applied data science, knowing that my work supports the wider community.

In summary, I bring a mix of hands-on technical expertise, problem-solving ability, and collaborative experience. I am committed to continuous learning and confident that I can support and grow with Hampshire County Council’s Integration Platforms team.
