Dear [Hiring Manager name],

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Data Enablement Lead position at Specsavers, as advertised on [Platform where you saw the ad]. With a background in developing and implementing data solutions that bridge the gap between technical infrastructure and business needs, I am confident that my skills in stakeholder collaboration, process automation, and fostering data literacy align perfectly with the goals of this role.

I am particularly drawn to Specsavers' mission of changing lives through better sight and hearing. My career is driven by a desire to see data translate into tangible, positive outcomes, and the opportunity to contribute to this mission by empowering teams with the tools and knowledge to make better, data-driven decisions is incredibly exciting.

In my current role as the sole data and infrastructure engineer at Motohaus Powersports, I have been responsible for the entire data lifecycle, from engineering to analysis and governance. A key part of my role involves partnering directly with non-technical stakeholders to understand their challenges and drive the adoption of new, automated processes. For example, I led the development of a critical data integration layer that automated data entry and now manages website listings for over ten thousand items. This involved gathering requirements from sales and procurement, building ETL processes with Python and SQL, and deploying a solution that has become indispensable to daily operations.

Beyond building solutions, I am passionate about championing best practices and elevating the technical capabilities of the organisation. I introduced modern development practices, including containerisation with Docker and the creation of an internal Python library, to improve the reliability, reusability, and scalability of our data processes. This experience has honed my ability to not only implement modern, cloud-first solutions but also to demonstrate their value and inspire a culture of discovery and continuous improvement, much like the proof-of-concepts and workshops mentioned in the job description.

My experience has prepared me to be the catalyst for change you are looking for. I am adept at turning complexity into clarity and am eager to apply my skills in communication, technical expertise (Python, SQL, Docker), and collaborative problem-solving to help Specsavers unlock the full potential of its data platform.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my CV for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can help drive meaningful change and better outcomes at Specsavers.

Yours sincerely,

Frey Lyons
