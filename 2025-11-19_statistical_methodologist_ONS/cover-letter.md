Dear MQD Resource Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Statistical Methodologist (SEO) position at the Office for National Statistics, as advertised. With a 1st-class honours degree in Economics with Data Science and extensive hands-on experience in statistical analysis, machine learning, and building production-ready data infrastructure, I am confident that I possess the skills and dedication to excel in this role and contribute meaningfully to the ONS.

My motivation stems from a strong desire to apply my analytical skills to work that serves the public good. The ONS’s mission to provide statistics that inform and underpin government policy resonates deeply with my academic and personal interests. My dissertation, which involved a panel data analysis of the negative externalities of Airbnb on local labour markets, gave me a profound appreciation for the power of robust statistical methods in understanding complex socio-economic issues. I am eager to bring this passion for evidence-based inquiry to an organisation at the heart of the UK’s analytical community.

In my current role as the sole data specialist at Motohaus Powersports, I have a proven track record of applying my knowledge to deliver impactful projects. For instance, faced with fragmented and error-prone data processes, I took the initiative to design, build, and deploy a complete data integration layer. Using Python, PostgreSQL, and Docker, I created a robust ETL pipeline that automated critical business processes and now serves as the single source of truth for over 10,000 products. This project demonstrates my ability to manage a project from conception to delivery, ensuring a high-quality service through rigorous testing and validation, directly aligning with the ‘Managing a Quality Service’ behaviour.

Furthermore, I have experience in leading statistical research and developing innovative solutions, a key requirement for an SEO-level Methodologist. When tasked with improving inventory management, I designed an MLOps pipeline for a high-dimensional forecasting problem using a DeepVAR model. This involved architecting services for cross-validation, training, and prediction. This work shows my aptitude for engaging with emerging methodologies like machine learning to solve complex statistical challenges. In this capacity, I was responsible for ‘Communicating and Influencing’ by explaining complex methodological choices and their implications to non-technical senior management to establish and meet their needs.

I am also committed to the Civil Service behaviour of ‘Developing Self and Others’. I proactively developed and shared an internal Python library to standardise common functions, promoting best practices and making our data processes more efficient and reusable. I am keen to continue this collaborative approach, coaching colleagues and contributing to the formidable expertise within the Methodology and Quality Directorate.

My academic background and practical experience in applying statistical and machine learning techniques make me a strong candidate for this role. I am excited by the prospect of contributing to the vital work of the ONS and would welcome the opportunity to discuss my application further at an interview.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,

Frey Lyons
