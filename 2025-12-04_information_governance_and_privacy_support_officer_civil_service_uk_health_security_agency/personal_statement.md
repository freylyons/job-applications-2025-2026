To the Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my profound interest in the Information Governance and Privacy Support Officer role at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), as advertised on the Civil Service Jobs portal. With a First-Class Honours degree in Economics with Data Science and comprehensive, hands-on experience in data engineering, governance, and automation, I am confident that I possess the analytical rigour, technical proficiency, and commitment to data integrity required to excel in this role. I am particularly drawn to UKHSA’s vital public health mission and am eager to apply my skills to contribute to a sector where the secure and ethical use of data has such a significant societal impact.

My academic background has provided me with a robust foundation in the principles of data analysis and statistical modelling, which is directly aligned with the essential criterion of a degree with a strong data science focus. For my final-year dissertation, I conducted a panel data research project investigating the negative externalities of Airbnb on local US labour markets using Python and R. This involved a complex ETL process using Python and SQLite to synthesise and clean disparate datasets, followed by rigorous regression analysis to model the impact. This project showcased my ability to manage a full data lifecycle—from sourcing and processing to analysis and reporting—and to derive meaningful conclusions from complex data, a skill I am keen to apply to the challenges faced by UKHSA.

In my current role as the sole data and infrastructure engineer at Motohaus Powersports, I have been responsible for the complete overhaul of the company's data architecture, which serves as a practical application of the Civil Service behaviour 'Managing a Quality Service'. When I joined, the organisation relied on fragmented and error-prone manual data entry across multiple ERP systems, leading to inconsistent and unreliable data. I was tasked with creating a unified and automated system to act as a single source of truth. To achieve this, I designed and implemented a multi-layer ETL stack using Python and a central PostgreSQL database. This system ingests raw, heterogeneous data from nine different suppliers, validates and cleanses it, and loads it into our production systems. This initiative transformed a high-effort, weekly manual task into a reliable, daily automated process, ensuring the integrity of data for over 10,000 items. This experience demonstrates my ability to identify systemic risks in data handling and to engineer robust solutions that embed data protection and integrity by design.

A core component of this success was my ability to 'Work Together' and 'Communicate and Influence' effectively. The design of the data model and integration layer required extensive collaboration with non-technical stakeholders across sales, procurement, and finance. I initiated and led workshops to capture their requirements, translating complex technical concepts into understandable business logic and ensuring the solution met their real-world needs. For example, by working with the finance team, I integrated specific logic to handle varied currency conversions and VAT calculations, which were previously a source of significant error. The successful adoption of this system across the business, and the subsequent elimination of data entry errors, is a testament to my ability to build positive working relationships and provide clear advice and support, as required by this role.

The job description highlights the need for a self-starter who can 'Deliver at Pace' and manage competing demands without direct supervision. As the only data specialist in my company, I have independently managed multiple high-stakes projects simultaneously. For instance, alongside the main ERP integration, I single-handedly architected and deployed a secure SFTP server in a containerised Docker environment. This server provides stock level data to our network of dealers, a critical function for the B2B side of the business. The entire process, from server provisioning and networking to writing the SQL code, was my responsibility. This demonstrates my capacity to take full ownership of a project, manage my time effectively under pressure, and deliver robust, production-ready solutions.

Furthermore, my experience aligns closely with the Civil Service behaviour of 'Changing and Improving'. I proactively identified the inefficiencies and risks in our existing processes and championed the adoption of modern development practices. By containerising our applications with Docker and creating a shared internal Python library for common functions, I introduced a level of standardisation and reliability that was previously absent. This not only improved the quality of our data services but also fostered a culture where processes were open to review and enhancement. I am confident in my ability to bring this same proactive and improvement-focused mindset to UKHSA, supporting initiatives to strengthen data and information risk management.

While my professional experience is in the private sector, I have a deep and long-standing interest in public service and the health sector. My degree in Economics equipped me with the skills to analyse complex systems and understand the wider societal implications of policy and data, which I believe is highly transferable to the health and care system. I am a keen learner, as evidenced by my self-taught proficiency in advanced data manipulation with Pandas and my exploration of mathematical concepts beyond my curriculum. I am eager to apply this 'Learner' strength to quickly develop a comprehensive understanding of the health and care system and the specific challenges of managing public health data.

In summary, I offer a unique combination of deep technical expertise in data engineering, a rigorous analytical mindset forged through my data science education, and proven experience in data governance and stakeholder management. I am adept at working autonomously to deliver high-quality, reliable systems and am passionate about applying these skills to support the crucial work of the UK Health Security Agency. I am excited by the opportunity to contribute to a strong data protection culture and to help maximise the public health benefit of the data UKHSA collects and uses.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
