Dear Russell Sheath,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the ICT Business Analyst position at Hampshire and Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service, as advertised. With a proven background in developing data-driven business solutions, automating processes, and acting as the key liaison between technical and non-technical teams, I am confident that my skills are an excellent match for the requirements of this role.

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity because it offers the chance to apply my technical expertise in a purpose-driven organisation dedicated to public service. My core motivation is to use technology to solve meaningful problems, a value that I see reflected in HIWFRS's commitment to "Supporting Others" and "Reaching Further". The prospect of contributing to an organisation that makes a tangible, positive impact on the community is incredibly compelling.

In my current role as the sole data engineer at Motohaus Powersports, I was tasked with transforming the company's fragmented and manual data processes. I took the initiative to design, build, and deploy a new data integration layer from the ground up. I consulted extensively with stakeholders to understand business needs, documented existing processes, and then architected a new automated ETL pipeline using Python, PostgreSQL, and Docker. This solution eliminated a five-hour weekly manual task, ensured data accuracy for over 10,000 items, and provided the business with a reliable single source of truth to support strategic decisions.

A similar project involved addressing significant inefficiencies in how non-technical staff handled spare parts data. I independently identified the issue, gathered requirements directly from the end-users, and developed a simple, automated solution. A critical part of this project's success was producing comprehensive user documentation and providing hands-on training to ensure a smooth transition. This not only improved data accuracy and completeness, but also empowered my colleagues by freeing them from a tedious, error-prone task.

My experience in analysing systems, documenting processes, and delivering user-centric solutions, combined with a CMI Level 4 qualification in Management and Leadership, has prepared me to effectively bridge the gap between ICT and its users. I am eager to bring my analytical skills and collaborative spirit to the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Frey Lyons
