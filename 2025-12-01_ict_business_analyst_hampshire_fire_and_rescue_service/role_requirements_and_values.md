As a data and systems engineer driven by a commitment to public service and process improvement, I am confident that I possess the analytical skills, technical expertise, and collaborative mindset required to excel as an ICT Business Analyst. My experience has prepared me to meet the challenges of this role with the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service, and my work is underpinned by values that I believe mirror your own.

My current role has honed my ability to act as a key liaison between the technical and business sides of an organisation. I have a proven track record of analysing business needs and translating them into effective technical solutions. A key example of this was a project to automate the upload of spare parts product information into our ERP systems. I began by independently consulting with non-technical customer service staff to fully understand their workflow. Through this process, I identified significant data inconsistencies and manual errors that were causing system-wide problems. I documented their requirements and the existing process, performing a gap analysis which revealed a critical need for standardised data entry and input validation. This is the kind of analysis and problem-solving I would be keen to apply at HIWFRS.

I thrive on turning such analysis into action. In my capacity as the sole data engineer, I took the initiative to design and build a full-scale data integration layer for our ERP systems. This project involved architecting a multi-layer ETL stack using Python, SQL, and Docker to automate a process that had previously consumed five hours of manual work every week. This new system now handles over 10,000 items daily and has become critical infrastructure. This demonstrates my ability to not only identify opportunities for improvement but also to deliver robust, production-ready solutions that help staff optimise their work and assist with the implementation of new projects. A core part of my philosophy is ensuring quality and reliability, so I introduced `pytest` for unit and integration testing to ensure the reliability of all new deployments and prevent regressions.

I am also adept at bridging the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders. Throughout the ERP integration project, I worked directly with a range of colleagues, from end-users in customer service to domain experts in finance and senior leadership. I made a point of communicating complex data models and system architecture in an accessible way, ensuring the solution met genuine business needs. This experience has been invaluable in developing my skills as a liaison, promoting the adoption of new technology and ensuring system designs deliver tangible benefits. To ensure the success of these projects, I also produced extensive user manual documentation and provided attentive onboarding and support, empowering the team to operate the new systems independently and effectively.

Beyond the technical requirements, I am particularly drawn to this role because my personal values resonate so strongly with those of HIWFRS. I am motivated by a desire to contribute to organisations that serve society, which aligns with your value of Reaching Further. I am driven by a desire for quality and reliability, constantly seeking to challenge the status quo to improve systems. My work on the data integration layer was a self-driven initiative to challenge our fragmented data practices and build a more robust, scalable solution for the future.

My work is built on a foundation of fairness, honesty, and integrity. When gathering requirements, I listen to and value the perspectives of all users, which I see as a reflection of Showing Respect. I also demonstrate the value of Supporting Others by focusing on the end-user experience. The spares upload automation project was born from listening to the frustrations of the customer service team and developing a solution that made their jobs easier. I find great satisfaction in applying my technical skills to support my colleagues. Finally, as the sole data engineer, I understand the importance of taking ownership and ensuring everyone plays their part. I am accountable for my work from end to end, but I also recognise that my success is dependent on collaboration with every part of the business.

My career goal is to apply my technical skills to solve meaningful problems. I am eager to bring my analytical, collaborative, and values-driven approach to the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service.
