Dear Leanne Williams,
                                                                                                                                                   
I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Data Analyst position at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), as advertised on the Civil Service Jobs website. With a strong background in designing and implementing data engineering solutions from the ground up and a passion for public service, I am confident that my skills align perfectly with APHA's goal to transform its data utilisation and enhance its analytical capabilities.
                                                                                                                                                                        
My motivation for this role stems from a deep-seated desire to apply my technical skills to work that serves the national interest. APHA's mission to safeguard animal and plant health is of critical importance, and the opportunity to contribute to this by providing high-quality data insights is incredibly compelling. I am driven to build robust, reliable systems that support effective operational and policy decisions, a value I believe is paramount in a public service context.

In my current role as the sole data engineer at Motohaus Powersports, I was tasked with a significant challenge: to modernise and unify the company's fragmented and error-prone data landscape. When I started, the business relied on manual, inconsistent data entry across multiple systems, leading to unreliable reporting and inefficient operations. My objective was to create a single source of truth by designing and building a robust data pipeline to automate data processing and improve analytical capabilities. I engineered a multi-layer ETL pipeline using Python, SQL, and Docker. This involved creating a central PostgreSQL database to act as a master data store, developing validation processes to ensure data quality, and building transformation layers to prepare semantic data models for business intelligence. A key part of this was collaborating closely with non-technical stakeholders to understand their requirements and ensure the outputs were not only accurate but also actionable. This aligns with the SEO behaviour of 'Changing and Improving', as I proactively identified process flaws and implemented a new, more effective system. The new system fully automated a process that previously took hours of manual work and enables the processing of business logic that was previously impossible, providing the vital foundation for our new stock procurement software, and providing reliable and timely data that now underpins key operational
decisions. This project demonstrates my ability to manage a data analysis project, engage with stakeholders, and deliver a high-impact outcome that improves service delivery, directly matching the core responsibilities of the Senior Data Analyst role.

My experience has equipped me with strong proficiency in Python, SQL, and data architecture principles relevant to the Azure Medallion model mentioned in the job description. I am adept at translating complex data into clear, actionable insights for non-technical audiences, a skill that reflects the 'Communicating and Influencing' behaviour. I am eager to bring my dedication to quality, continuous improvement, and public service to the Data Insights team at APHA.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my skills and experience can contribute to the vital work of the Animal and Plant Health Agency.

Yours sincerely,

Frey Lyons
