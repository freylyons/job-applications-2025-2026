I see this Early Careers Programme as the bridge between the solid foundations I have already built in data engineering and DevOps, and the depth of professional experience I want to develop over the next five years. In my current role, I have gained practical experience designing ETL pipelines, containerising Python applications, and implementing CI/CD workflows. These have given me a strong grounding in automation, problem-solving, and building reliable systems.

I am particularly keen to deepen my knowledge of service provisioning with Ansible/Terraform and container orchestration with Kubernetes. With my current experience, I feel ready to take the next step and contribute to deploying robust, scalable services in production environments. The structured training and mentorship offered through this programme will accelerate my growth in these areas while also helping me refine collaboration, communication, and testing practices within a larger engineering team.
