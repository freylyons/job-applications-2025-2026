Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Senior Data Engineer position at your consultancy, as advertised on CV-Library. With a strong foundation in data engineering, a proven ability to deliver impactful solutions, and extensive experience in stakeholder management, I am confident that I possess the skills and dedication to excel in this role and contribute significantly to your team.

The opportunity to work in a dynamic consultancy environment, tackling a diverse range of data challenges for various clients, is particularly appealing. My current role as the sole data and infrastructure engineer at Motohaus Powersports has equipped me with a robust and adaptable skillset. I have been responsible for the entire data lifecycle, from gathering requirements from non-technical stakeholders to designing, building, and deploying production-ready data systems. A key project involved creating a critical data integration layer using Python, PostgreSQL, and Docker. This system automated data entry and now governs the website listings for over ten thousand products, demonstrating my ability to build scalable, reliable solutions that directly address core business needs.

My technical expertise aligns well with the requirements of this role. I am highly proficient in Python and SQL, and I have hands-on experience with DevOps practices, including containerisation with Docker and administering CI/CD pipelines. My work has involved migrating and integrating data between disparate systems, and I have a strong understanding of data governance and standardisation within a rapidly changing commercial environment. I am a UK resident and am confident in my ability to obtain the necessary security clearance for this position.

My academic background, a 1st-class honours degree in Economics with Data Science, has provided me with a strong analytical and quantitative foundation, which I have consistently applied throughout my career. I am eager to bring my experience in building end-to-end data solutions, mentoring colleagues, and collaborating across business functions to your consultancy.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my CV for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can benefit your organisation.

Sincerely,

Frey Lyons.
