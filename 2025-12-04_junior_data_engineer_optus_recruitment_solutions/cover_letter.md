Dear Kumbirai Mafini,

As a Data Engineer with hands-on experience in building and automating data pipelines using Python and SQL, I was excited to see the Junior Data Engineer role advertised on Opus Recruitment Solutions. My background in developing end-to-end data systems and my keen interest in applying these skills to solve meaningful, real-world problems align perfectly with the mission of your organisation.

The opportunity to join a mission-driven start-up dedicated to bringing transparency and efficiency to the healthcare sector strongly resonates with my personal and professional values. I am motivated to use my technical skills to contribute to projects that have a positive societal impact, and your company's work in uncovering inefficiencies and wrongful behaviour is exactly the kind of meaningful challenge I am seeking.

In my current role at Motohaus Powersports, I was tasked with being the sole data and infrastructure engineer, where I inherited a fragmented and manual data management process. My objective was to automate critical business workflows and establish a single source of truth for product and operational data. To achieve this, I designed and built a multi-layer ETL stack using Python, PostgreSQL, and Docker. This system automates the ingestion, validation, and transformation of data from multiple disparate sources, loading it into our production ERP systems. This solution fully automated a previously error-prone manual process, and now manages the state of over 10,000 product listings, forming a piece of critical infrastructure for the company's ecommerce operations. It also involved collaborating closely with non-technical stakeholders to ensure the solution met business needs.

Beyond my core data engineering duties, I have actively pursued my interest in machine learning. I proactively initiated a project to design an MLOps pipeline for a stock forecasting system. This involved designing services for cross-validation, training, and prediction, and researching non-parametric models like DeepVAR to handle high-dimensional, incomplete data. Although the project was ultimately paused to prioritise more immediate business needs, the research and development process solidified my understanding of ML architecture and my enthusiasm for the field. This experience demonstrates my genuine interest in AI and my initiative to learn and apply these technologies, and I am eager for the opportunity to grow these skills in a supportive environment like the one you offer.

My experience with Python, SQL, and building automated data systems, combined with my strong desire to learn and grow within a mission-driven team, makes me a confident candidate for this role. I am excited by the prospect of contributing to your team and helping to shape how data drives real-world change.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I have attached my CV for your review and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
Frey Lyons
