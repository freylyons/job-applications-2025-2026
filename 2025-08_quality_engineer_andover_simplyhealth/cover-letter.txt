Andover, UK

Dear Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Quality Engineer position at Simplyhealth. Your mission to improve healthcare access and your pioneering status as the first UK health insurer to achieve B Corp certification resonate deeply with me. I want my engineering work to contribute to something meaningful, and I am inspired by the opportunity to support a purpose-driven company that prioritises both social and environmental impact.

In my current role, I have been the sole engineer responsible for consolidating and automating fragmented data processes across the business. I designed and deployed ETL pipelines that reduced a two-hour weekly manual task into a daily automated process, implemented CI/CD workflows with Docker Compose and GitHub, and introduced unit and integration testing practices to improve reliability. Acting as both data engineer and DevOps practitioner, I built reproducible, testable systems from scratch while collaborating directly with end users to validate requirements. These experiences have honed the same skills your role emphasises: deconstructing solutions into testable components, embedding automation, and advocating for quality across delivery.

What excites me most about this opportunity is the chance to bring that same drive for quality into a professional environment that values rigour and learning. In my own time, I am exploring NixOS and reproducible builds to deepen my expertise in testability and system reliability. Combined with my background in economics - where I focused on the social effects of corporate giants on labour and housing markets - I bring both technical skills and a strong belief in building systems that serve people, not just profit.

I am eager to contribute my engineering expertise, quality mindset, and passion for purpose-driven work to Simplyhealth’s mission of making healthcare more accessible. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can support your teams in delivering reliable, high-quality products that make a positive difference.

Warm regards,
Frey Lyons
